# HuntShowdownSpawnMap

The excel file provided is the data set I have used. The data set contains 100 game spawn locations from TRIOS only.
If you want the visualization, just copy paste the contents of the file into the input box in the provided .html file.

If you want to make your own data set and want to visualize it, just click on the map in the html and it will tell the nearest location it knows for the visualization.

The same spreadsheet can be found here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHfu1qDmJwxkngT5wg7K3EbqAmc-uVKLguTJvaeE_tY if you want to share the dataset
